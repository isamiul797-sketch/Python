#Python For Loops
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)

#Looping Through a String
for x in "banana":
  print(x)

#The break Statement
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break
  
#Exit the loop when x is "banana", but this time the break comes before the print
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    break
  print(x)

#The continue Statement
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    continue
  print(x)

#The range() Function
for x in range(6):
  print(x)

#The range() function defaults to 0 as a starting value, however it is possible to specify the starting value by adding a parameter: range(2, 6), which means values from 2 to 6 (but not including 6):
for x in range(2, 6):
  print(x)

#The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3):
for x in range(2, 30, 3):
  print(x)

#Else in For Loop
for x in range(6):
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")

#Note: The else block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement.
for x in range(6):
  if x == 3: break
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")

#Nested Loops
adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for x in adj:
  for y in fruits:
    print(x, y)

#The pass Statement
#for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass
